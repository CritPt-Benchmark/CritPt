Importantly, the final logical GHZ state being produced by the circuit $(|00\\rangle_{AB}+|11\\rangle_{AB})/\\sqrt{2}$ is a $+1$ eigenstate of the logical $X_A X_B = IXXI$ and $Z_A Z_B=IZZI$ operators. Therefore, any Pauli errors that are logically equivalent to these operators, up to multiplication by stabilizers, do not affect the logical state. By going through the $57$ undetectable Pauli errors, we find that $9$ of them are logically equivalent to $X_A X_B$ and $Z_A Z_B$ (up to stabilizers) and so do not affect the logical state.

We then assess if that Pauli string leads to an error detection event (or ancilla check event) and if the Pauli string leads to a logical error.
