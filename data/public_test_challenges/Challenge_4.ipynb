        "High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear optical process in which intense laser fields interact with gas-phase atoms or molecules to produce coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. In this setup, a sequence of time-delayed laser pulses are focused into a gas jet to investigate the role of structured light in controlling the HHG process."

        "I create a driving field composed of three temporally identical laser pulses of 800 nm center wavelength, 50 fs FWHM pulse duration, with the peaks of the pulses at t = 0 fs, t = 30 fs, and t = 60 fs, respectively. The first pulse is left circularly polarized and carries an orbital angular momentum (OAM) of  $\\ell = -1$, the second pulse is right circularly polarized and has OAM $\\ell = 2$, and the third pulse is left circularly polarized and has OAM $\\ell = 1$. The pulses are focused, overlapped in space, into a gas jet, and used to drive high-harmonic generation to produce EUV light. Calculate the OAM of the 23rd harmonic order and give the associated helicity $\\sigma$ ($\\pm 1$)."
