        "Quantum contextuality, like Bell nonlocality, is a key signature of nonclassicality in quantum information. There are two widely accepted notions of quantum contextuality: Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and Spekkens' generalized contextuality.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest KS contextuality proof uses five three-outcome projective measurements, denoted as KCBS measurements $\\{M_i\\}_{\\text{KCBS}}$, where\n",

        "and $  \\alpha =\\arccos\\left((\\frac{1}{5})^{1/4}\\right).$\n",
        "\n",
        "These measurements exhibit state-dependent KS contextuality: their Born-rule statistics cannot be reproduced by any deterministic noncontextual model, which can be proven by the violation of the KCBS inequality,$$W=\\sum_i\\langle\\Pi_i\\rangle\\le 2.$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Though both the KS and Spekkens frameworks could conclude that such a set of measurements is useful for proving quantum contextuality,  the KS test only works for projective measurement assuming deterministic response functions; Therefore, one cannot discuss the notion of white-noise robustness for these measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "By comparison, in Spekken's framework,  the deterministic response function can be justified through preparational noncontextuality, and the minimal set of states for that justification are defined by the rank-1 operators in $\\{M_i\\}_{\\text{KCBS}}$, i.e.,\n",
