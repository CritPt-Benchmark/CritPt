        "Effective field theory is a powerful tool used to construct phenomenological models via symmetries. The method has recently been extended to dissipative systems via the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this problem we will study the dissipative effective field theory associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking of multipolar $U(1)$ symmetries.\n",
