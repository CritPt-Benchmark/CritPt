The state $|a\\rangle$ is the marked vertex on this graph. We choose the initial state $|s\\rangle$ to be the equal superposition of all vertices. We want to choose the proper value of $\\gamma$, and let the system evolve for the appropriate duration of time such that, at the end of the process, the system is maximally concentrated at the state $\\left|a\\right\\rangle$.\n\n# Main problem:\n\nSuppose $M=200$.
