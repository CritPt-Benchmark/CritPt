Above the transition, the space group of the system is \\#182, and the atoms we are interested in are located at the Wyckoff position c. Below the transition, the magnetic order is out-of-plane, and the neutron scattering shows two peaks (one at $q_1$ = (0, 1/2, 0) and the other at $q_2$ = (1/2, 1/2, 0)). The optical measurements show that the system has both birefringence and magneto-optic Kerr effect below the transition.\n\n# Main problem:\n\nPlease specify all possible magnetic space groups for the system below the magnetic phase transition. The answer should be provided using the BNS number.",
