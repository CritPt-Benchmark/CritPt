The cluster expands into space with long-range power-law interactions. In one dimension, the asymptotic size of the cluster,  denoted by $\\ell(t)$, satisfies a self-consistent equation:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\frac{1}{\\ell^{\\mu}(t)} \\int_0^t \\ell(\\tau) \\ell(t - \\tau) d\\tau = K.\n\\end{equation}\nHere, $\\mu$ is the power-law index of the long-range interaction, and $K$ is a constant independent of time.\n\n# Main problem:\n\nConsider the specific scenario where $\\mu = 2$, and let us define $\\varphi = \\log_2 \\ell$ and $z = \\log_2 t$. Expand $\\varphi$ in terms of $z$  for large $t$ and retain terms up to constant order in $z$. That is, you should fix any $\\text{polylog}(z)$ corrections such as $\\log_2(z)$ and $\\log^2_2(z)$ if they are present; constant corrections can be ignored.",
