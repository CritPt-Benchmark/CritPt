Two of them correspond to a pair of Wannier orbitals centered at the 2c position (i.e., edge center) in each unit cell. Four of them correspond to Wannier orbitals centered at the 1b position (i.e., plaquette center). And the others correspond to Wannier orbitals centered at the 1a position (i.e., lattice site).\n\n\n\n# Main problem:\nConsider a disclination with Frank angle $–\\pi/2$ (i.e., a 90° wedge removed).\nIf the translation-equivalence class is nontrivial, what fractional charge (in units of the electron charge e) is trapped to the disclination core?\nWhat if the translation-equivalence class is trivial?\n\nIf we consider one additional occupied band with Wannier orbitals at 1b position with angular momentum $l=+1/2$, what are the quantities above?\n\nExpress each anwser as a value in $[-1/2,1/2)$.",
