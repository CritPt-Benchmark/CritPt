This is typically done by tiling a few unit cells of the materials into a supercell with volume $\\Omega$. Using periodic boundary conditions, the simulation can access only a finite number of momenta, which are compatible with the supercell. As a result, the total energy calculated in the simulation will have a finite-size error, which is the difference between the result from an infinite system and that of a finite-size one. It is possible to correct this finite-size error if given access to the many-body wave function.\nThe density of the electron gas is typically parameterized using the Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s$. When unpolarized, the Fermi wavevector $k_F=\\sqrt{2}/r_s$.\n\n# Main problem:\n\nAfter performing a diffusion Monte Carlo simulation of the unpolarized two-dimensional electron gas with $N=122$ electrons at density $r_s=10$ in a square box in the Fermi liquid phase using the Slater-Jastrow wave function, what should one add to the total energy per electron to remove finite-size effects?
