At $ t = 0 $, there is one permutation $ w_0 = (123 \\cdots n) \\in S_n$.\n2. At $ t = 1 $, $ w_0 $ splits into $ w_1 w_2 $.\n3. At $ t = 2 $, first $ w_1 $ splits into $ w_3 w_{4-} $, and $ w_2 $ splits into $ w_{4+} w_5 $. Then $ w_{4\\pm} $ merge into $ w_4 = w_{4-} w_{4+} $.\n4. At $ t = 3 $, the first splitting event is\n  \\begin{equation}\n  w_3 = w_6 w_{7-}, \\quad w_4 = w_{7+} w_{8-}, \\quad w_5 = w_{8+} w_{9-},\n  \\end{equation}\n which is followed by the merging event\n  \\begin{equation}\n  w_7 = w_{7-} w_{7+}, \\quad w_8 = w_{8-} w_{8+}.\n  \\end{equation}\n5. This process continues.\n\nAll the $w$'s are permutations in $S_n$. The pattern is such that at the boundary the permutation just splits, but in the middle the neighboring permutations labeled with $ - $ and $ + $ will merge. Thus, one will end up with one more permutation each time.\n\nSuppose all of these splittings are minimal decompositions defined as follows: Let $ d(g) $ be the minimal number of transpositions in $ g $. $ g = g_1 g_2 $ is a minimal decomposition when the total minimal number of transpositions does not change, i.e.,\n\\begin{equation}\nd(g) = d(g_1) + d(g_2).\n\\end{equation}\nThis holds for any product decomposition in this problem.\n\nLet the number of configurations at time $ t $ be $ a_n(t) $.\n\n# Main problem:\n\nCompute $ a_{40}(3) $. Note that there may be multiple configurations that lead to the same $w_5 $, $ w_6 $, $ w_7$ and $w_8$ at $t = 3$. You should count all of them. Return your answer as an integer.",
