We use $|1\\rangle$ to denote the excited state and $|0\\rangle$ for the ground state. The Rydberg blockade forbids adjacent $1$s. The system's Hamiltonian is given by\n\\begin{equation}\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^L P_{i-1}X_iP_{i+1},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $X_i$ is the Pauli X operator acting on the $i$th spin, and $P_i$ is the projector $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ on site $i$, indicating that excitations are only possible when both neighboring sites are in the $|0\\rangle$ state.\n\nWe impose periodic boundary conditions, and the Hamiltonian exhibits both translation and reflection symmetries. As a result, we can block diagonalize the Hamiltonian into simultaneous eigenstates of the lattice translation operator $T$ and reflection operator $P$. We consider the subspace $\\mathcal{D}_0^+$, which has zero momentum and even reflection parity.\n\nThe scar eigenstates have exceptionally larger overlap with the $Z_2$ state $|101010\\cdots10\\rangle$ compared to the neighboring eigenstates.\n\n# Main problem:\n\nFor the eigenstates inside $\\mathcal{D}_0^+$, list the energies of the scar states and the base-10 logarithm of their overlap with the $Z_2$ state: $\\log_{10}|\\langle Z_2|\\psi\\rangle|^2$. All numerical results should be given to four decimal places. Set the system size to $L = 26$.",
