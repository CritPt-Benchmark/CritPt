The method has recently been extended to dissipative systems via the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this problem we will study the dissipative effective field theory associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking of multipolar $U(1)$ symmetries.\n\n\nConsider a $1d$ system with a conserved density $N = \\int \\rho$, conserved dipole moments $D = \\int x \\rho$, and a conserved quadrupole moment $Q = \\int x^2 \\rho$.
