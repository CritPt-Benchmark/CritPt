        "Consider a 4-fold rotationally symmetric 2D insulator on a square lattice with ten occupied Wannierizable bands. Two of them correspond to a pair of Wannier orbitals centered at the 2c position (i.e., edge center) in each unit cell. Four of them correspond to Wannier orbitals centered at the 1b position (i.e., plaquette center). And the others correspond to Wannier orbitals centered at the 1a position (i.e., lattice site).\n",
