        " Consider three identical bosons with spatial coordinates $\\vec{r}_1$, $\\vec{r}_2$, and $\\vec{r}_3$.  Define Jacobi vectors $\\vec{r}_{ij} = \\vec{r}_i - \\vec{r}_j$ and $\\vec{\\rho}_{k,ij} = (2\\vec{r}_k - \\vec{r}_i - \\vec{r}_j)/\\sqrt{3}$, where $(i,j,k)$ is a permutation of $(1,2,3)$.  The hyperradius is defined as $R^2 = (r_{ij}^2 + \\rho_{k,ij}^2)/2$.  We use notation $r_{ij}= |\\vec{r}_{ij}|$ and $\\rho_{ij}= |\\vec{\\rho}_{ij}|$. The hyperangle $\\alpha$ is defined as $r_{ij}=2R\\sin\\alpha_k$ and $\\rho_{k,ij}=\\sqrt{2}R\\cos\\alpha_k$ such that $\\alpha_k = \\arctan(r_{ij}/\\rho_{k,ij})$.  The range of the hyperangle is restricted between $0$ and $\\pi/2$ such that $r_{ij}$ and $\\rho_{k,ij}$ remain always positive.  We define the shorthand $\\alpha\\equiv \\alpha_3$ as well as permutation operators $\\hat{P}_{13}$ and $\\hat{P}_{23}$, where $\\hat{P}_{ij}$ is the permutation operator that swaps particle indices $i$ and $j$.\n",
