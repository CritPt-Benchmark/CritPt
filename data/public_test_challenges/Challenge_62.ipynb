        "Quantum superposition of a single particle can be demonstrated by the interference pattern observed in a double-slit experiment. Although it has been shown that no genuine triple-slit interference exists for a single quantum particle, an $N$-slit experiment can still reveal stronger nonclassical patterns, detectable through violations of the following inequality (Note: A classical theory that allows $N-1$-slit inteference cannot violate such an inequality.):\n",
