        "Consider a scalar field $\\phi$ linearly coupled to the standard model electromagnetic field with coupling strength $\\Lambda_\\gamma^{-1}$. We can write the interaction term of the Lagrangian as $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{int}=\\frac{\\phi}{4 \\Lambda_\\gamma}F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}$. Assuming the scalar field makes up all the dark matter, it may induce observable effects in laser interferometers. We consider signals of scalar field in the Cosmic Explorer, whose planned strain sensitivity is about $2\\times 10^{-25}\\, \\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ in the frequency range of $50\\,\\text{Hz} \\leq f \\leq 500\\,\\text{Hz}$. The interferometer arm length of Cosmic Explorer is designed to be $40\\, \\text{km}$. We assume the Cosmic Explorer uses a similar beamsplitter as LIGO, with thickness $6\\,\\text{cm}$ and index of refraction $3.5$."
