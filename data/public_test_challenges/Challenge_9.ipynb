        "In order to introduce torsion to the system, one can use the first-order formulation of general relativity. We define a local reference frame at each point of the $(3+1)$-dimensional manifold $\\mathcal{M}$, the tetrad $e^A_\\mu$, such that the metric can be written as $g_{\\mu\\nu}=e^A_\\mu e^B_\\nu \\eta_{AB}$, where $\\eta_{AB}$ is the flat Minkowski metric on the internal space of coordinates. The internal indices, denoted by the Latin alphabet, also run from $0$ to $3$ just like the spacetime ones. The metrics $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $\\eta_{AB}$ can raise or lower the spacetime and internal tangent-space indices, respectively. The Levi-Civita symbol shall be denoted by $\\epsilon_{ABCD}$.\n",
