        "Two dielectric nanoparticles are deeply trapped in two Gaussian optical traps that propagate along the $z$-axis, both characterized by the wave vector $k$ and the Rayleigh range $z_R$. Suppose the focal planes of these traps are located at $z=0$, and the nanoparticles are located at $z=z_1$ and $z=z_2$ respectively, where ${z_1},{z_2} \\ll {z_R}$. Let the distance between the two nanoparticles be $d$, satisfying the far-field condition $kd \\gg 1$. The polarizabilities of the two nanoparticles are $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$, respectively. Both the tweezers have identical polarization, the electric field amplitudes are $E_1$ and $E_2$, and the phases at the focal planes are $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, respectively."
