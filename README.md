# CritPt

CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking – Physics Test; reads as "critical point") is the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamics, biophysics, and accelerator physics.

It currently includes 71 challenges and 190 checkpoints, crafted by a team of 50+ active physics researchers from 30+ leading institutions worldwide, including senior Ph.D. Candidates, Postdocs, and Professors. 

Evaluation Pipeline and more challenges are coming soon.
